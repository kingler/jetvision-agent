# ✅ UI Fixed and Running!

## Status: **WORKING**

The JetVision Agent UI is now successfully running and accessible!

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Import Error**: Fixed `IconWorkflow` import error in `structured-data-display.tsx`
   - Changed to `IconNetwork` which exists in the icon library
2. **Greeting Format**: Fixed newline issue in greeting (changed `/n` to `\n`)
3. **Server Running**: Development server is active and serving the application

### Access Information:

**URL:** http://localhost:3003

**Port:** 3003 (ports 3000-3002 were in use)

### Environment Configuration ✅
