# Chat Submit Button Fix

## Issues Fixed

I've diagnosed and fixed several issues with the chat submit button not working:

### 1. **JSON Stringify Issue**
**Problem**: The query was being passed as a JSON stringified object instead of plain text
**Fix**: Changed `formData.append('query', JSON.stringify(jsonPayload))` to `formData.append('query', messageText)`

### 2. **Missing detectIntent Function**
**Problem**: Referenced `detectIntent()` function that didn't exist
**Fix**: Removed the undefined function call

### 3. **Editor Text Validation**
**Problem**: Editor text wasn't being properly checked
**Fix**: Added proper null checks and debugging

### 4. **Debug Logging Added**
Added comprehensive logging to track the flow:
- Button click events
- Editor text content
- Message sending process
- Loading state changes

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)

2. **Try Sending a Message**:
   - Type a message in the chat input
   - Click the send button or press Enter
   - Watch the console for debug messages

3. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   [SendButton] Clicked - hasTextInput: true isGenerating: false
   [SendMessage] Starting - isSignedIn: true chatMode: [mode]
   [SendMessage] Editor text: [your text] Custom prompt: undefined
   [SendMessage] Setting isGenerating to true
   Sending message to n8n: [your text]
   ```

## What Should Happen Now

When you click the submit button:

1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**:
   - Loading state should appear
   - Input should clear
   - Optimistic thread item created

2. **Progress Indicators**:
   - "Connecting to JetVision Agent..." message
   - Progress bar showing status
   - Real-time updates as workflow executes

3. **Response Display**:
   - Text response in markdown format
   - Structured data cards for Apollo/Avinode data
   - Execution metadata badges

## If Still Not Working

Check the browser console for errors:

1. **"No text to send"** - Editor might not be initialized properly
2. **Network errors** - Check n8n webhook URL is accessible
3. **Auth issues** - May need to sign in first

## Additional Fixes Applied

- Fixed editor getText() reference
- Added proper error handling
- Improved loading state management
- Fixed FormData construction
- Added fallback for editor commands

The chat should now work properly. Type a message and click the send button - you should see immediate feedback and the message should be sent to the n8n webhook.
