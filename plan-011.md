Please update the prompt popup UI component to align with the overall application design system. Here are the specific requirements:

1. **Remove all emojis** from the prompt cards and interface elements

2. **Match the chat page card styling**: Update the prompt cards to use the same visual design, spacing, and styling as the cards found in the new chat page view

3. **Implement expandable card grid layout**:
    - Use a grid layout for displaying prompt cards
    - Cards should be expandable to show editing interface
    - Include save functionality for edited prompts

4. **Add prompt insertion functionality**: Include a button on each prompt card that allows users to insert the selected prompt directly into the ChatInput field

5. **Ensure design consistency**: The entire UI should maintain visual consistency with the overall application's design system, including:
    - Color scheme and typography
    - Button styles and interactions
    - Spacing and layout patterns
    - Component hierarchy and visual weight

6. **Reference screenshot**: Use the provided screenshot at '/Users/kinglerbercy/Desktop/Screenshot 2025-09-04 at 8.31.31 AM.png' as the current state that needs to be improved

Please first analyze the existing prompt popup component and the chat page card styling to understand the current implementation, then create a detailed plan for the UI updates before making any code changes.

**The time has come to make a choice.** Execute a comprehensive redesign of the PromptCardsModal component to modernize its UI and align it with the main application's design system. This is not merely a cosmetic update - it's a fundamental transformation of the prompt library interface.

**PHASE 1: Icon System Modernization**

- Locate and modify `prompts-parser.ts` to remove ALL emoji characters from the CATEGORY_ICONS object
- Replace each emoji with semantically appropriate icons from `@tabler/icons-react` library
- Ensure icon selection follows the existing design patterns used throughout the main application
- Verify icon imports are properly added and unused emoji references are completely removed

**PHASE 2: Visual Design Consistency**

- Analyze the existing card styling in `PromptCards.tsx` to extract the exact CSS classes and design patterns
- Apply identical styling to PromptCardsModal cards including:
    - Border: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800`
    - Background: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`
    - Shadow: `shadow-md hover:shadow-lg`
    - Hover states: `hover:border-gray-300 dark:hover:border-gray-700`
    - Maintain consistent padding, margins, and typography scales
- Ensure perfect dark/light mode compatibility across all new components

**PHASE 3: Layout Architecture Transformation**

- Replace the current sidebar-based layout with a responsive grid system
- Implement in-place card expansion functionality where cards grow vertically to reveal editing interfaces
- Add React state management for tracking which cards are currently expanded (use useState or useReducer)
- Design the expanded state to include:
    - Editable text areas for prompt content
    - Save/Cancel action buttons
    - Validation feedback for prompt modifications

**PHASE 4: Functional Integration**

- Add "Insert Prompt" buttons to each card that integrate with the existing `handlePromptSelect` mechanism
- Ensure the insertion properly focuses the ChatInput editor and positions the cursor correctly
- Implement visual feedback (subtle animation or highlight) when a prompt is successfully inserted
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing prompt selection workflows

**PHASE 5: User Experience Enhancements**

- Preserve and enhance the existing search functionality with improved filtering algorithms
- Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter to select, Escape to close)
- Implement loading states for any asynchronous operations
- Add smooth transitions and micro-animations for expand/collapse actions
- Ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes

**PHASE 6: Quality Assurance**

- Test all interaction flows including search, selection, editing, and insertion
- Verify proper state management and no memory leaks from expanded cards
- Confirm accessibility standards are met (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Validate that the modal maintains proper focus management and can be dismissed appropriately

**Files Requiring Modification:**

1. `prompts-parser.ts` - Icon system overhaul
2. `prompt-cards-modal.tsx` - Complete component redesign
3. `PromptCards.tsx` - Reference for styling consistency (read-only analysis)
4. `prompt-cards-button.tsx` - Potential minor updates for visual consistency

**Success Criteria:**
The completed implementation should be visually indistinguishable from the main chat interface cards while providing enhanced functionality. Users should experience a seamless, modern interface that feels like a natural extension of the main application rather than a separate modal experience.

**Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.** Execute this transformation with precision and attention to detail.

## Git Workflow

Break down large tasks into separate, smaller, manageable subtasks. For each subtask, follow this Git workflow:

1. Create Feature Branch: Create and checkout a new feature branch from main using a descriptive name (e.g., feature/task-name or fix/issue-description)

2. Implementation: Implement the specific subtask changes in the feature branch

3. Testing & Validation:
    - Run all relevant tests to ensure they pass
    - Run the build process to verify no compilation errors
    - Perform any necessary linting or code quality checks

4. Integration:
    - If tests pass and build succeeds, merge the feature branch back to main
    - Delete the feature branch after successful merge

5. Final Verification:
    - Run the build process again on the merged main branch to ensure no breaking changes were introduced
    - Run tests on main to confirm integration stability

6. Commit & Push:
    - If everything works correctly, commit the changes with a clear, descriptive commit message
    - Push the updated main branch to the remote repository

Repeat this complete workflow for each individual subtask/feature request. This ensures each change is isolated, tested, and verified before integration, maintaining code quality and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Execute the following systematic UI enhancement plan for the JetVision Agent project, implementing each subtask sequentially with proper validation at each step.

## Project Context

- Repository: `/Volumes/SeagatePortableDrive/Projects/jetvision-agent-project`
- Target: Enhance prompt cards modal interface with professional styling and improved functionality
- Build system: Bun (use `bun run` commands)
