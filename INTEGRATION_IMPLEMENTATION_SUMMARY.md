- `POST /api/integration/sync` - Control sync operations
- `DELETE /api/integration/sync` - Clear audit logs

**Webhook Processing:**
- `POST /api/integration/webhook` - Handle real-time events
- `GET /api/integration/webhook` - Test functionality

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Suite ✅

**Integration Tests:**
- `/__tests__/integration/mcp-integration.test.ts` - Full system integration tests

**Unit Tests:**
- `/__tests__/unit/mcp-client.test.ts` - Core MCP client tests

**Test Coverage:**
- Connection management and pooling
- Service layer functionality
- Error handling and resilience
- Data synchronization operations
- Event system functionality
- Performance and concurrency testing
- Security and validation testing

### 7. Webhook Integration ✅

**Real-time Event Handling:**
- Apollo.io webhook processing (lead updates, sequence completion)
- Avainode webhook processing (booking confirmations, availability updates)
- N8N webhook processing (workflow completion, execution status)
- Generic lead processing webhook for direct pipeline triggers

**Event Types Supported:**
- `lead_created`, `lead_updated`, `sequence_completed` (Apollo)
- `booking_confirmed`, `booking_cancelled`, `aircraft_availability_updated` (Avainode)
- `workflow_completed`, `workflow_failed`, `execution_status` (N8N)

const result = await manager.processLeadToBooking(leadData, flightRequirements);
```

### Direct Service Access
```typescript
const services = manager.getServices();

// Search Apollo leads
const leads = await services.apollo.searchLeads({ industry: 'Aviation' });

// Search aircraft
const aircraft = await services.avainode.searchAircraft({
  departureAirport: 'KJFK',
  arrivalAirport: 'KLAX',
  departureDate: '2024-04-01',
  passengers: 8
});
```

### Data Synchronization
```typescript
import { DataSyncService } from './lib/mcp/data-sync';

const syncService = new DataSyncService(manager);
syncService.startAutoSync(15); // Every 15 minutes
await syncService.performFullSync(); // Manual sync
```
