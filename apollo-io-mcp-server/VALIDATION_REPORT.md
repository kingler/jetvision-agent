   - Add contacts to email sequences
   - Create deals for tracking
   - Set follow-up tasks

### 2.3 N8N Configuration Requirements

```javascript
// N8N HTTP Request Node Configuration
{
  method: "POST",
  url: "http://localhost:8123/mcp",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "mcp-session-id": "{{session_id}}"
  },
  body: {
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "tools/call",
    params: {
      name: "tool_name",
      arguments: { /* tool parameters */ }
    },
    id: "{{request_id}}"
  }

## 8. Limitations and Considerations

### 8.1 Known Limitations

1. **API Key Required:** Full functionality requires valid Apollo.io API key
2. **Rate Limits:** Apollo API has usage limits that must be respected
3. **Bulk Operations:** Limited to 10 items per request
4. **Mock Mode:** Limited functionality without API key

### 8.2 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage:** Use environment variables, never commit keys
2. **Input Sanitization:** Implement server-side validation
3. **HTTPS:** Use SSL/TLS in production
4. **Access Control:** Implement authentication for MCP server access

## 9. Recommendations

### 9.1 Implementation

1. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
2. **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Add request logging** for debugging and audit trails
4. **Monitor API usage** to stay within limits
5. **Cache frequently accessed data** to reduce API calls

### 9.2 N8N Workflow Best Practices

1. **Error Handling:** Add error branches in N8N workflows
2. **Rate Limiting:** Implement delays between bulk operations
3. **Data Validation:** Validate inputs before API calls
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for failed workflows
5. **Testing:** Create test workflows with mock data first
