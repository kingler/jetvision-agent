You must install and analyze the llmchat repository (https://github.com/trendy-design/llmchat.git) and provide a comprehensive customization plan for creating a JetVision-branded chat interface. 

Here are the ui integration file with clear requirements to align with JetVision's brand and messaging.
[jetvision-chatui-integration-plan](jetvision-chatui-integration-plan.md)

[JetVision Description](jetvision.md)
**Objective**: Transform the existing llmchat UI to create a specialized JetVision Agent interface for private jet charter services.

**Required Analysis**:
1. **Component Identification**: Scan the codebase and identify all UI components, configuration files, and styling assets that need modification for agent-specific branding
2. **Branding Elements**: Locate where to implement JetVision's luxury aviation branding including:
   - Color schemes (luxury aviation palette)
   - Typography (professional, premium fonts)
   - Logo placement and sizing
   - Aviation-themed iconography
   - Luxury design patterns

**Specific Requirements**:
- **Agent Persona**: The interface should reflect JetVision's 20+ years of jet industry expertise
- **Industry Context**: UI elements should incorporate aviation/transportation terminology and imagery
- **Business Model Integration**: Interface should support JetVision's services (private jet charter, concierge services, membership programs, empty leg flights)
- **User Experience**: Design should convey luxury, reliability, discretion, and premium service quality

**Expected Deliverables**:
1. File-by-file breakdown of components requiring modification
2. Specific code locations for branding updates
3. Asset requirements (images, icons, fonts)
4. Configuration changes needed for JetVision agent behavior
5. Styling modifications for aviation industry aesthetics
6. Any architectural changes needed for agent specialization

Focus on practical implementation details with exact file paths and code sections that need updates.

The LLMChat interface should accommodate the following JetVision-specific requirements:
