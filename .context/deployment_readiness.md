// Only contains basic Feedback model
model Feedback {
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  userId String
  feedback String
  metadata Json?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

// MISSING CRITICAL MODELS:
// - User profiles and preferences
// - Apollo.io lead and campaign data
// - Avinode aircraft and booking data
// - Conversation history
// - Business intelligence data
```

**Production Impact:** Cannot persist business-critical data

#### Testing Infrastructure (50%)
```bash
# Current test failures blocking production:
❌ Cannot find module '../../app/api/n8n-webhook/route'
❌ Cannot find module '@testing-library/react'
❌ 0 passing tests, 2 failing tests
```

**Coverage Status:**
- Estimated current coverage: 30%
- Production requirement: 80%
- Missing: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests

#### Error Handling and Monitoring (40%)
- ❌ No production error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- ❌ No application performance monitoring
- ❌ No health check endpoints
- ❌ Limited error recovery mechanisms outside N8N integration

## Critical Production Blockers

### 🚨 Blocker 1: Build Configuration Issues
```javascript
// apps/web/next.config.js - PRODUCTION UNSAFE:
module.exports = {
  typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },  // ❌ CRITICAL
  eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true },     // ❌ CRITICAL
  // ... other config
}
```
**Impact:** Hidden production errors, quality issues
**Required Action:** Remove error ignoring, fix underlying issues

### 🚨 Blocker 2: Single Point of Failure
```typescript
// All AI requests route through N8N with no fallback:
const model = "jetvision-agent" // Always routes to N8N
```
**Impact:** System failure if N8N is unavailable
**Required Action:** Implement direct API fallbacks

### 🚨 Blocker 3: Incomplete Data Layer
**Missing Database Models:**
- User profiles and business data
- Apollo.io leads and campaigns  
- Avinode aircraft and bookings
- Conversation history
- Analytics and reporting data

**Impact:** Cannot persist business operations
**Required Action:** Complete database schema implementation

### 🚨 Blocker 4: No Error Monitoring
**Missing Production Monitoring:**
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- System availability monitoring

**Impact:** Cannot detect or respond to production issues
**Required Action:** Implement comprehensive monitoring
