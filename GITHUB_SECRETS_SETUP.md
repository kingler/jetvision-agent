# GitHub Secrets Configuration

## Current Status
The GitHub Actions workflows are failing because required secrets are not configured in the repository.

## Required Secrets

To fix the failing GitHub Actions, add these secrets:

### 1. Go to Repository Settings
Navigate to: https://github.com/kingler/jetvision-agent/settings/secrets/actions

### 2. Add Required Secrets

#### For Cloudflare Deployment:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
  - Get from: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
  - Create token with "Edit Cloudflare Workers" permissions

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: `485f44eabd68fe8c5301c12472a02612` (from wrangler.toml)

- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`: Your domain's zone ID
  - Find in Cloudflare dashboard > Your domain > Overview (right sidebar)

#### For Clerk Authentication (Optional):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: `pk_test_bmV1dHJhbC1tdXNrb3gtMjQuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: `sk_test_s9GSF8dhPCq5Ps4rpZjdyyqhT5jaYs5IuMI5W8dlod`

#### For Slack Notifications (Optional):
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Slack webhook URL for deployment notifications

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Vercel for Deployments (Currently Active)
Since Vercel is already configured and working, you can:
1. Continue using Vercel for the web app: https://jetvision-agent-60l43purk-kingler-bercys-projects.vercel.app
2. Disable the failing GitHub Actions workflow

### Option 2: Disable Failing Workflows
To stop the failing checks:

```bash
# Rename or delete the problematic workflow
mv .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudflare.yml .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudflare.yml.disabled
```

### Option 3: Use Simple Workflow
A simpler workflow (`deploy-simple.yml`) has been created that:
- Builds the project without requiring secrets
- Skips Cloudflare deployment until secrets are configured
- Works with the existing Vercel setup

## Current Working Deployments

✅ **Vercel (Working)**: Automatically deploys on push to main
- URL: https://jetvision-agent-60l43purk-kingler-bercys-projects.vercel.app

✅ **Avinode MCP Server (Working)**: Already deployed to Cloudflare
- URL: https://avainode-mcp.designthru.ai

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term**: Disable the failing workflow to clear the red X's
2. **Long-term**: Add the Cloudflare secrets if you want GitHub Actions to deploy to Cloudflare Pages
3. **Alternative**: Continue using Vercel which is already working

## Disable Failing Workflows Command

Run this to disable the failing workflows:

```bash
cd /Volumes/SeagatePortableDrive/Projects/jetvision-agent
mv .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudflare.yml .github/workflows/deploy-to-cloudflare.yml.disabled
git add .
git commit -m "Disable Cloudflare workflow until secrets are configured"
git push
```
